    <h1>I Am Learning to Code!</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h2>I Am Terrified of All of This</h2>
    <p>There is, at least for me, a certain level of anxiety to coding. I feel super cool typing and writing codes but it is also very
        stressful at the same time. <br>I am very talented at dragging and dropping things into buckets on the super user
        friendly websites such as <a href="https://www.wix.com">Wix.com</a>, but typing a bunch of stuff into a solid screen 
        and hoping it turns out well is very, very scary.
    </P>
    <p>On the other hand, when I can sucessfully turn a bunch of words and symbols into a webpage that actually loads
        in a mainstream browser, I feel like:
            <ul>
                <li>A wizard</li>
                <li>A genie</li>
                <li>Taylor Swift</li>
            </ul>
    <p>I mean, Taylor Swift has got to feel like she is making magic when she rattles off a song. I heard her on a
            talk show once saying that she can create a song in, maybe, half an hour. <br>That's gotta be magic.
        That's gotta be actual magic.</p>
    <h2>I Do Not Intend to Give Up</h2>
    <p>I am prone, especially when frustrated, to bouts of crying. But that's okay. It releases stress, so I'll just cry and work. At least it's fall so I can have
        windows open and a cool breeze will blow across my face while I cry. Whoops, this is Kansas where it's in the 
        nineties until Mid-October.</p>
