    <h1>I am terrified of all of this</h1>
    <p>There is a certain level of anxiety to coding. I feel super cool typing and writing codes but it is also very
        stressful at the same time. I am very talented at dragging and dropping things into buckets on the super user
        friendly websites such as <a>http://www.wix.com</a>Wix.com, but typing a bunch of stuff into a solid screen 
        and hoping it turns out well is very, very scary.
    </P>
    <p>On the other hand, when I can sucessfully turn a bunch of words and symbols into a webpage that actually loads
        in a mainstream browser, I feel like:
            <ul>
                <li>A wizard</li>
                <li>A genie</li>
                <li>Taylor Swift</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I mean Taylor Swift probably feels like she is making magic when she rattles off a song. I heard her on a
            talk show once saying that she can create a song in, maybe, half an hour. That's gotta be magic.</p>
