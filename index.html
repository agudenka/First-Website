    <h1>I Am Learning to Code!</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h2>I Am Terrified of All of This</h2>
    <p>There is, at least for me, a certain level of anxiety to coding. I feel super cool typing loudly and entering snippets of code but it is also quite
        stressful at the same time. <br>I am very talented at dragging and dropping things into buckets on the super user
        friendly websites such as <a href="https://www.wix.com">Wix.com</a>, but typing a bunch of stuff into a solid screen 
        and hoping it turns out well is very, <strong>very</strong> scary.
    </P>
    <p>On the other hand, when I can sucessfully turn a bunch of words and symbols into a webpage that actually loads
        in a mainstream browser, I feel like:
            <ul>
                <li>A wizard</li>
                <li>A genie</li>
                <li>Taylor Swift</li>
            </ul>
    <p>I mean, Taylor Swift has got to feel like she is making magic when she rattles off a song. I heard her on a
            talk show once saying that she can create a song in, maybe, half an hour. <br>That's gotta be magic.
        That's gotta be <em>actual</em> magic.</p>
    <h2>I Do Not Intend to Give Up</h2>
    <p>I am prone, especially when frustrated, to bouts of crying. But that's okay. I know that it releases stress, so I'll just cry and work. 
        <br>At least it's fall so I can have
        windows open and a cool breeze will blow across my face while I cry. Whoops, this is Kansas where it seems to be in the 
        nineties until October.</p>
        <p> I like to tell my children, my students, and myself that we can all do hard things. We just need to persevere, to keep trying.
            So what I must do, also, is to persevere and just keep trying new things until I have a website that makes me proud.
        </p>
        <p> Sometimes, when I feel stressed out I look at trees, or imagine that I am out in the wilderness. Perhaps I am on a hike in this visualization
            (<em>obviously</em> this fictional hike happens on a cool day with moderate cloud cover - sweaty hikes are not my preferred type of hike).
        After I have spent a moment calming myself through visualization, I refer to my text book and my notes, and I try again!</p>
    <br>See below for an example of the mental hike I'm taking during my breaks from coding on this project. Isn't it <strong><em>beautiful</em></strong>?</p>

    <!--- I hope that you like my website. The only thing I could think of for content was my feelings! 
        Now that I've made my first website, this is actually pretty fun. Also, I did not cry once while doing it. I can do hard things! -->
